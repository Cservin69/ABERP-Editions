// PR-44η / session-60 — pin tests for the `buttonsForState`
// per-state action-button visibility helper.
//
// Mirror invariant per A163: the per-state visible-button table is
// the load-bearing operator-facing contract. The backend's
// `serve::submit_invoice_request` / `serve::poll_ack_request`
// helpers loud-fail with 409 on state-mismatched POSTs; this table
// keeps the SPA from surfacing a button that would always 409.
// CLAUDE.md rule 9 — per-state coverage means a regression that
// collapses every state to one button list (or returns a constant)
// cannot pass every assertion vacuously.
//
// The eleven `InvoiceState` values are pinned exhaustively below.
// A new state added to the union without a `buttonsForState` arm
// would surface as a TypeScript exhaustiveness error at
// `npm run check` (the function uses a `switch` over the typed
// union with no default arm); this table catches the runtime
// affordance choice.
